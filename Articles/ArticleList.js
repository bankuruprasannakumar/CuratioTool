Think Marlon Brando in \u201cThe Wild One\u201d (or his jeans, anyway). Where does one go to buy a pair? Ideally, Japan, where denim brands use old-school shuttle looms to fastidiously reproduce the styles of 1947. Luckily for New Yorkers, raw selvage can be found at several shops in the city that carry the coveted Japanese brands or make their own denim in that vein, or both. Consider  , at 157 Orchard Street, a store open for six years that treats denim like a religion.   stocks only brands from designers who have \u201csoul to what they do,\u201d said Andrew Chen, a partner of Self Edge New York. To illustrate the point, he held up the \u201cforeman pant,\u201d the latest release from Roy Slaper, who makes every pair of Roy jeans himself in his workshop in Oakland, Calif. The pocket bag material is a funky design; the inside stitching is made on a vintage machine that leaves a seashell pattern. \u201cYou just can\u2019t do this on a production line,\u201d Mr. Chen said. Elsewhere, hanging on iron hooks, were a highly edited sampling of jeans by 3sixteen, a denim brand founded and carried by Self Edge, as well as Japanese favorites like Flathead and Sugar Cane. Another Japanese brand, Iron Heart, makes the heaviest denim the shop carries, jeans that wear like a stiff canvas sack until broken in. \u201cAfter a year or two, you end up with a jean that you\u2019re really proud of, that you did work on,\u201d Mr. Chen said. Prices range from $190 to $360. And Self Edge also offers hemming and repair services; the hemming is performed on a Union Special, which Mr. Chen assured was the holy grail of vintage chain-stitch machines. , at 85 North Third Street, Brooklyn, carries selvage and non-selvage styles. In contrast to the minimalist gallery approach of Self Edge,   stacks its jeans in piles on tables and shelves, an initially daunting shopping experience made navigable by the store\u2019s expert staff. Brooklyn Denim carries the brand, First Standard, which is made in the shop, along with labels like Levi\u2019s Made & Crafted, Tellason, Strom and the Japanese brands Big John and Japan Blue. Kenny Abiog, a co-owner, said the store also makes custom jeans for denim heads who have something in mind that they can\u2019t find in the store. Prices for custom start at $795. Repairs and hemming are also offered. Perhaps the city\u2019s best source for custom denim, though, is  , at 15 Mercer Street, the brand founded by Scott Morrison, formerly of Paper Denim Cloth and Ernest Sewn. Here, the feeling is a denim atelier, with bolts of selvage fabric in indigo hues hanging on the wall and workers operating sewing machines in the middle of the store. The brand offers three options: a ready-to-wear collection ($250 to $325); a custom jean where you pick the fabric, buttons, zipper, thread and other details (starting at $525); and a tailor-made jean (starting at $1,200), ideal for athletes and others with specific sizing requirements. Mr. Morrison walked a customer through the   custom process, explaining the difference between red and green cast fabric (the red is the all-American blue jean, the green is favored in Europe and Japan) and dispensing tips like how to create a dressier jean (choose a matching thread color). Still, Mr. Morrison said, 3x1 will make any custom jean you can think of using its hand-loomed denims and detail kit, no matter how bold. \u201cThis is about whatever you want,\u201d he said.

This was deep in hippie antiquity. In another two years I would be out on my own in Manhattan, running around with a random bunch of creative, amphetamine-addled nutjobs whose lives centered mainly on Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory (the second one, up on the sixth floor of the Decker Building on Union Square) and attempting to figure out how to make it as an artist, writing at that point being about the furthest thing from my mind. Very little from that period survives anymore except in memory. True, I did for years carry the ropy braid, which I\u2019d impulsively lopped one day, from place to place in an old metal deed box. Then I lost it in a house fire, which is probably just as well. But there is something besides the many stories I accumulated that has stayed with me. Perhaps it is the only thing. It is the jeans jacket my mother bought me when I turned 14, correctly identifying my teen rebellion as a phase. Though I wear it less often now than I did when it was part of my hippie uniform, or later, when it had developed just the right amount of rattiness to help me blend in with the regulars at the Mudd Club, that jacket still hangs in my closet. It\u2019s back there behind the fancier designer-label things. And while I would never go so far as to suggest that a jeans jacket is the first thing I\u2019d grab in the event of another house fire, I hope never to part with it. In truth, I would not mind wearing it to my grave. Levi\u2019s made that jacket, of course, as Levi\u2019s has been making various essential Western garments since around the Gold Rush. In a photo I found in a history of this storied denim purveyor, a rider is standing alongside his horse. One hand is on his hip and the other rests on the pommel of his saddle. The man, Hugh E. Neal, also known as Shorty Neal, is credited as the last of the Pony Express riders and has on ragged chaps, a back-tilted Stetson and a jacket that was still referred to by Levi\u2019s when the picture was taken in 1949 as a denim \u201cblouse.\u201d I love this picture and for a simple reason: You would be hard pressed to find an image of a man more persuasively at ease in his clothes. The deep pleating in the front of the blouse Mr. Neal is wearing is designed like a bellows, made so wearers could add layers underneath as protection from bitter Western winters. But for some details \u2014 more pockets, a waist cinch, a red tab, the pleats gone \u2014 his jacket is little different from the one my mom gave me or from the many that have dominated street-style snapshots for at least a year. And while I tend to distrust anything related to trends, the current ubiquitous one for wearing jeans jackets \u2014 specifically the style known as the trucker \u2014 in all settings and with all kinds of other garments (including with a tuxedo, as at Dior Homme) is one I\u2019d be glad to see stick around. There is something unarguably great about fashion\u2019s widespread embrace of this utilitarian item of workwear: about the look of a beat-up trucker under a cashmere topcoat (or over a C\u00e9line frock, for that matter); about the tidy way a jeans jacket\u2019s design bisects a man\u2019s body at the waistline, its double-V vertical front seams lending the wearer \u201can \u00fcbermensch, Superman look,\u201d according to Jonathan Cheung, the Levi\u2019s brand head of design; and about the references it instantly evokes to archetypes of both Americana and rockers of every possible stripe \u2014 from dinosaurs like Keith Richards to dance-music tyros like the hitmakers Odesza. \u201cJeans jackets are tough as nails,\u201d said Andrew Chen, owner of Self Edge and the designer of the specialty denim label 3Sixteen. Better yet, they neatly satisfy many of the   by Dieter Rams. Honest, good to the last detail, useful, unobtrusive, so well designed they barely look designed at all, they are also quite clearly long lasting. Anyway, mine is. Decades of hard use have seemingly done nothing but improve it, which is honestly more than I can say about myself.

This week, Levi\u2019s, the oldest jeans company in the world, is setting in motion its biggest salvo yet, fighting back against market incursions from not only other high-fashion jeans brands but also, perhaps more meaningfully, the upstart \u201cathleisure\u201d movement. The NPD Group, a market research firm, reported that sales of women\u2019s jeans in the United States declined 5 percent in the year ended April 2015; meanwhile, Mark Parker, the chief executive of Nike, has been proclaiming that when it comes to women, leggings are \u201cthe new denim.\u201d Not if Karyn Hillman, the chief product officer of Levi Strauss & Company, has anything to do about it. Eighty years after introducing its first women\u2019s jeans, Levi\u2019s will unveil what Ms. Hillman calls the most comprehensive rethinking of its female-centric styles since 1934. The rejig is a result of two years of research, including a \u201cglobal safari\u201d to cities like Chicago, Shanghai, Hamburg and Stockholm (though not any city in Africa, Russia or the Middle East, which makes the name a little misleading, and is surprising given that Levi\u2019s is a market leader in South Korea and Russia). There were hundreds of interviews with women of different ages (20 to 50), body types and ethnicities. The update involves larger back pockets, for more flattering optics; new branding, especially the \u201ctwo horse pull\u201d label on the waistband (on all the styles, from the Lot 700s to the Lot 500s); and a new brand ambassador,  . But most of all, it involves new fabrications. Especially stretch. \u201cThe one comment that came up in every interview was that fabric and feeling is now as important as fit,\u201d Ms. Hillman said, a possible side effect of the rise of activewear, with its related emphasis on nonconstricting but formfitting materials. \u201cFive or even three years ago, that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d Indeed, according to Euromonitor\u2019s \u201cJeans in the United States\u201d executive summary, \u201cdenim is challenged on the comfort factor.\u201d As a result, the new Levi\u2019s Lot 711 to 721 is 20 to 40 percent stretch, and the new 710s are 50 to 90 percent stretch. That\u2019s almost yoga-worthy flexibility. This was, as it happens, part of what attracted Ms. Keys to the project, one of the few brand ambassadorships she has assumed. (She was the face of the Givenchy fragrance Dahlia Divin and had a brief stint as creative director of BlackBerry.) \u201cMy personal jeans slogan is, \u2018If it ain\u2019t tight, it ain\u2019t right,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Keys said. \u201cIt\u2019s my motto.\u201d But, she said, even though Levi\u2019s is now her partner, \u201cThey can\u2019t use it.\u201d (She did not appear fazed by recent reports that skinny jeans had cut off one woman\u2019s circulation. When asked about that, Ms. Hillman said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe skinny jeans are ever going away.\u201d) Ms. Keys said that growing up in New York she always wore Levi\u2019s, but she admitted to experimenting with other brands. Still, she said, \u201cI always found my way back.\u201d For the current campaign, she found her way to the new 501s and the high-waist skinny styles. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better because the stretch is really comfortable,\u201d she said, pointing out that she had just had her second child. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie on the bed to get them up. You know, I\u2019m a very shapely woman, and often a lot of fashion does not seem to celebrate a shapely woman. But that courtesy should be present in everything we wear.\u201d Ms. Keys will appear in a video made for TV and movie theaters as well as digital, which features a song entitled \u201c28,000\u201d (the number of days in an average life) from her coming album. Print ads will also feature emerging indie musicians like Ryn Weaver and the French-Cuban sisters the Ibeyi twins. It is, said Jennifer Sey, Levi\u2019s chief marketing officer, the biggest investment Levi\u2019s has ever made in a woman\u2019s campaign, though she declined to quantify it precisely. In the past, the company has focused on gender-neutral marketing. \u201cWe think there is a lot of opportunity for growth in this area,\u201d Ms. Hillman said. But to capture that audience, Ms. Keys said, \u201cWe deserve our own conversation pieces.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on July 9, 2015, on page D3 of the   with the headline: Levi\u2019s Rethinks Its Women\u2019s Line.  \n ", "title": "Levi&#39;s Responds to Challengers With Revamped Women&#39;s <b>Jeans</b> <b>...</b>"},{"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png", "contentType": "Read", "productUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/13/t-magazine/seventies-denim.html", "textArea": "\t \n     \n             \n    \n        \t\t                                 Seventies fashion again feels of the moment, with denim styles as loose and freeing as they were in the disco era. For inspiration, look no further than to three stylish women of the period. The American style icon Lee Radziwill (above, at home in New York in 1976) wore a casual, frayed pair of jeans that are almost enough to make you want to break out a pair of shears. The French actress Sylvie Vartan (pictured here striding down a Los Angeles sidewalk in 1976) paired billowing bell-bottoms with a very Parisian striped shirt. Yoko Ono wore dark, wide-legged jeans as she walked with John Lennon in New York in 1971.  ", "title": "<b>Jeans</b> Made for Walking Down Memory Lane - The <b>New York Times</b>"}]';
